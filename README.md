# scala-gdrive-project

## Commands
ls - list files  
cd - changes directory  
rm - deletes files/directories
mv - moves files/directories
exit - exits the program
forceUpdate - forces a download/sync of metadata information from Google Drive

Type <command> -h for command help.

## Design Decisions
Limited functionality for directory names  
Memory-based rather than asking Drive every single time
